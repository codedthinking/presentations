# Tidy data
## Data vs story
Contrary to the aphorism, data is *not* the plural of anecdote.
- known structure
- known collection method

## Benefits of (more) data
- Less subject to selection/recall bias.
- Statistical learning can be applied.

## Drawbacks of (more) data
- Harder to work with.
- Harder to interpret/relate to.
- May give false sense of knowledge.

## Tidy data
1. Every row is an observation (case, record)
2. Every column is a variable (feature, attribute)
3. Every cell contains a single value

## Spreadsheet as a canvas
